1718,ニューヨークには沢山ホテルのある中で、4つ星の中では値段も高かったのですが、お友達も泊まった事も有り、お掃除の面で一番良かったので此処にしました。ルーム内はちょっと狭いのですがセーフテイーボックスも有り、毎日ベットリメイクやタオルも変えてくれるので、お湯もいい感じに出ました。ちなみに21階でした。エレベーターも早いので、エレベーターに乗る前にホテルの人がカードキーチェックを入れエレベーターを使用することができるので安全です。建物はかなり古いので、あまり新しくはありませんが皆さん親切で、チェックインの時はクレジットカードでデポジット45＄を一泊につき先払い。チェックアウトはカードキーを渡すだけでチェックアウト出来ました。7日以内にデポジット代がカードに返金されると言うことです。 そしてチャックアウトの日にスーツケースをロビーの奥に置くのに1つにつき5€でした。ホテルのロビーから、3つのレストランのアクセスができてtick tokはアメリカらしいパンケーキ食べれましたが、サービス料金が高めででも24時間なのか人が朝から晩まで居ます。ホテルのインフォメーションカウンター横には、コーヒーとマフィンなど甘いものが手軽に朝だけ買えるコーナーがあります。コーヒー2、6＄くらいでした。後反対側にはイタリアンレストランに、ticktok の下にはステーキハウス、かなり高いみたいですが、見に行くだけ行ってみてください。素敵なレストランです。ホテルを出て右に34th Penn station左にも別の入り口が有り地下鉄で、いろいろなとこにアクセスできます。反対側のマデイソンスクエアガーデンの所にも、電車の大きな駅もあり、周りには24時間営業のお店が有り、ファーストフードも沢山あって便利です。8th av から34th street 5th av に向かって沢山お店もありタイムススクエア迄も歩いて10分程度です。ミッドタウンはホテルが沢山ありますが高いクラスの方です値段枠。タクシーの運転手さんがちなみに、次回はハーレム、ブロンクスが安くていいホテルがあっていいと勧められました。昔に比べてかなり綺麗でお巡りさんも居て安全らしいです。空港ーホテル56＄フラット料金でホテルの前にもタークシー乗り場あります。日中移動は地下鉄が、タクシーは渋滞でかなりの金額になりますがあちこちで捕まります。とにかく地下鉄駅界隈最高でした！,2019-04-01,,"Among the many hotels in New York, the price was the highest among the 4 stars, but I chose this place because it was the best in terms of cleaning because my friends stayed there. The room is a little small, but there is also a safety box, and the bed remakes and towels are changed every day, so the hot water was nice. By the way, it was the 21st floor. The elevator is also fast, so it is safe because the hotel staff can check the card key and use the elevator before getting on the elevator. The building is quite old, so it's not very new, but everyone is kind and pays a credit card deposit of $ 45 per night at check-in. You can check out just by handing your card key. It means that the deposit fee will be refunded to the card within 7 days. And on the day of the chuck out, it cost 5 € per suitcase to put in the back of the lobby. From the lobby of the hotel, 3 restaurants were accessible and tick tok was able to eat American pancakes, but even if the service fee is high, there are people from morning till night, maybe 24 hours a day. Next to the hotel information counter, there is a corner where you can easily buy sweets such as coffee and muffins only in the morning. Coffee was about $ 2,6. There is an Italian restaurant on the other side and a steakhouse under ticktok, which seems to be quite expensive, but just go see it. It's a nice restaurant. There is another entrance on the left side of the 34th Penn station on the right side of the hotel, and you can access various places by subway. There is also a large train station at Madison Square Garden on the other side, there are shops open 24 hours a day, and there are plenty of fast foods, which is convenient. There are many shops from 8th av to 34th street 5th av, and Times Square is about 10 minutes on foot. There are many hotels in Midtown, but they are in the higher class. Price limit. By the way, the taxi driver recommended that I have a good hotel in Harlem and Bronx next time. It's much cleaner than it used to be, and it seems safe to have a policeman. Airport-Hotel There is a Turksey platform in front of the hotel for a flat fare of $ 56. The subway is used for daytime travel, and the taxi is congested and can be quite expensive, but it is caught here and there.

While there are hotels like the relics of the last century in the neighborhood, this hotel seems to be the only (?) 4-star hotel in Chinatown, and the exterior and new rooms were suitable for that grade. However, it's not a big hotel, so it's easy to check out. The reception staff was also very friendly and liked it. A few minutes' walk away, there is one of Chinatown's leading supermarkets, and when I entered it, it was prosperous, so the product lineup was reasonable and the price was reasonable. If you walk for about 5 minutes, you can eat porridge early in the morning, there are many restaurants that are open until late at night, and there are many cheap and reliable massage shops in Asia. If you want to enjoy a hybrid trip where you can enjoy the culture of Japan, you have to use this hotel as a base. I even think. Finally, there are a few negative points. 1. 1. Since there is no shower room door, that is, there is only half the threshold, hot water will inevitably splash toward the toilet when using the shower. 2. 2. It's a pity that I didn't put slippers. 3. 3. I'm grateful that there was a desk, but the brightness of the overhead lighting wasn't enough, so it wasn't an environment where I could read books. However, I would like to use this hotel with outstanding cost performance next time.","埼玉県, 日本",None,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,POSITIVE

Customer service and cleanliness are reasonable for the price. The good thing is that there is always water in the lobby. Coffee is available until around 10 o'clock in the morning.

Since a strong-smelling detergent is used for cleaning, the lobby is unpleasant due to the smell of detergent. Breakfast can be served at the adjoining bar, but when you book a room with breakfast, the menu you can eat for free is quite a $ 12 fruit platter and a Danish pastry for the United States. Frugal. Is this $ 12? ?? It was a small amount. Other menus can be ordered by paying the difference. Please note that coffee and drinks will be charged separately.
