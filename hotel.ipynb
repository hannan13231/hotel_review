I didn't use the three things and I said this at check-in. You have to pay this fee if you use the things or not I can't get my throat full, I'll take that. The in-house Tik Tok Diner is another thing On our last visit we were there almost every day to eat because it was super tasty on the one hand, but the concept was changed. The burgers from $ 16 and smaller than cheeseburgers at McDonalds taste terribly bad and all other dishes are no longer good, just expensive spaghetti Bolognese for 19 $ I am aware that New York Manhattan is very, very expensive € 5,0006,000 a week including flights and meals, but you need it with you\n",

We were shocked that when we left we weren't even charged almost $ 32 PER NIGHT so-called “facility fee”. It was written in the small print when booking. So the hotel wasn't really cheap If you take this into account, there would have been cheaper alternatives in the area without additional charge We would not recommend the hotel to others The location is really good Directly at Penn Station In the area there are nice restaurants at reasonable prices e.g. Chef Yu You can also find nice bars Some with live music The subway lines ACE are right outside the door The 123 lines one block away You can get everywhere quickly The rooms are very shabby Everything is generally acceptable but nothing is completely renewed The toilet was clogged for us The repair was not done in the evening although Reported in the morning the room service should have noticed In general, the water ran extremely badly actually not acceptable We were on the 24th floor The view of the street was good However, the windows were so dirty that the view was only possible The curtains weren't cleaned for ages The view was ok The beds were good, the towels etc were clean and plentiful The shower had good hot water and good water pressure\n",

      "The hotel is perfectly located Right next to the Pen Station Subway which takes you about where you want to go Newark train station Airpost is also next door Short walk to sights like Empire State Building Time Square Broadway Rockefeller Center 5Af Macy's etc. The hotel room was very small so this is normal in the whole city If you go on holiday to discover the city this is not a problem Nice service clean rooms every day The standard of the room is a bit older but in my opinion it was some of the charm A little difficult to find the right temperature in the shower If you want a hotel holiday where a lot of time is spent in the hotel I would go for something elseBoth breakfast diner Tick Tock and restaurant in the hotel The restaurant was good but somewhat expensive The diner is also currant although I recommend going around the corner to Stardust Diner which was better and cheaperAll in all a good hotel experience that can be recommended tips ask about the view of the Empire State Building it was a beautiful sku e to wake up every morning\n",

      "Among the many hotels in New York, the price was the highest among the 4 stars, but I chose this place because it was the best in terms of cleaning because my friends stayed there. The room is a little small, but there is also a safety box, and the bed remakes and towels are changed every day, so the hot water was nice. By the way, it was the 21st floor. The elevator is also fast, so it is safe because the hotel staff can check the card key and use the elevator before getting on the elevator. The building is quite old, so it's not very new, but everyone is kind and pays a credit card deposit of $ 45 per night at check-in. You can check out just by handing your card key. It means that the deposit fee will be refunded to the card within 7 days. And on the day of the chuck out, it cost 5 € per suitcase to put in the back of the lobby. From the lobby of the hotel, 3 restaurants were accessible and tick tok was able to eat American pancakes, but even if the service fee is high, there are people from morning till night, maybe 24 hours a day. Next to the hotel information counter, there is a corner where you can easily buy sweets such as coffee and muffins only in the morning. Coffee was about $ 2,6. There is an Italian restaurant on the other side and a steakhouse under ticktok, which seems to be quite expensive, but just go see it. It's a nice restaurant. There is another entrance on the left side of the 34th Penn station on the right side of the hotel, and you can access various places by subway. There is also a large train station at Madison Square Garden on the other side, there are shops open 24 hours a day, and there are plenty of fast foods, which is convenient. There are many shops from 8th av to 34th street 5th av, and Times Square is about 10 minutes on foot. There are many hotels in Midtown, but they are in the higher class. Price limit. By the way, the taxi driver recommended that I have a good hotel in Harlem and Bronx next time. It's much cleaner than it used to be, and it seems safe to have a policeman. Airport-Hotel There is a Turksey platform in front of the hotel for a flat fare of $ 56. The subway is used for daytime travel, and the taxi is congested and can be quite expensive, but it is caught here and there. Anyway, the area around the subway station was the best!\n",

You can enjoy your stay because there is everything around you. The only difficulty is that I can hear the sounds and stories of people coming and going in the next room, probably because the walls are thin, and I think it's a little worrisome when it overlaps with the time to sleep. This depends on who is next to you. Other than this, there was a feeling of cleanliness and it was a satisfying stay.\n",

      "The hotel is one block away from Canal Street, the main street in Chinatown. While there are hotels like the relics of the last century in the neighborhood, this hotel seems to be the only (?) 4-star hotel in Chinatown, and the exterior and new rooms were suitable for that grade. However, it's not a big hotel, so it's easy to check out. The reception staff was also very friendly and liked it. A few minutes' walk away, there is one of Chinatown's leading supermarkets, and when I entered it, it was prosperous, so the product lineup was reasonable and the price was reasonable. If you walk for about 5 minutes, you can eat porridge early in the morning, there are many restaurants that are open until late at night, and there are many cheap and reliable massage shops in Asia. If you want to enjoy a hybrid trip where you can enjoy the culture of Japan, you have to use this hotel as a base. I even think. Finally, there are a few negative points. 1. 1. Since there is no shower room door, that is, there is only half the threshold, hot water will inevitably splash toward the toilet when using the shower. 2. 2. It's a pity that I didn't put slippers. 3. 3. I'm grateful that there was a desk, but the brightness of the overhead lighting wasn't enough, so it wasn't an environment where I could read books. However, I would like to use this hotel with outstanding cost performance next time.\n",

I paid the price I got confirmed including taxes and fees10USD Why I would now pay it but to get rid of the problem I accepted that the hotel took this without much fuss upgraded to 2 rooms with sofa bed which was good with 4 In the family but to call it on Executive floor is fun considering how it is in Asia\n",

I was a little worried because there was no person in charge to leave my luggage freely and I left it in a room where anyone could freely enter. The concierge was kind enough to accept reservations for restaurants that are difficult to reach by phone.

Resort fee and parking very expensive but parking offers valet parking 24 hours a day and they are very quick to pick up your car Returning to the Disney buses that are available on the way to go seated But the last buses take a while and are crowded and usually to the Lake Buena vista Disney Springs you go standing just around the corner where you are very tiredI think total neglect I don't see this transport as something free I complained at the hotel reception about the buses *the delay * and availability for the hotel they told me to call Disney and said they had nothing to do with it Disagree They should inform Disney your guest's dissatisfaction and ask for more buses to this hotel at the latest times Because availability is much higher for hotels within the park You can see that I saw a certain prejudice against Latinos, I could be wrong but I felt this\n",

      "It is a Hotel that in general lines recommended with Madison very close and not far from Empire to access Times Sqare it takes 1520 minutes on foot Reception They speak Spanish the rooms are clean although mine had a small bathroom THE WORST to transfer us to the airport a hotel concierge offered us a transportation service for 5 people for a price of 100 dollars when we got to the airport an official taxi charged us 55 euros and given that it was raining heavily and it was very difficult to find a taxi we agreed. A private vehicle and he took us to the airport and when it was time to pay, he demanded $ 120 from us to which we replied that they had told us 100 at the hotel to which he argues that he had taken the highway, which is uncertain since it is the first time We made that journey and we know the passage through the control of the highway there begins a tug of war until, as always, we give in TO THE SCAM as the plane leaves. I go to the hotel to be more serious when it comes to collaborating with unscrupulous taxi drivers who are only to deceive the tourist that if as long as the hotel itself or its staff is not in collusion and that excess payment made goes directly to their pockets Lastly, if it rains, you have to leave the hotel at least hours in advance to get to the airport and have enough time\n",

Coffee is available until around 10 o'clock in the morning. (Although it is normal in hotels). What I was interested in was that there was no laundry (room service cleaning is possible) because it was a long stay. Since a strong-smelling detergent is used for cleaning, the lobby is unpleasant due to the smell of detergent. Breakfast can be served at the adjoining bar, but when you book a room with breakfast, the menu you can eat for free is quite a $ 12 fruit platter and a Danish pastry for the United States. Frugal. Is this $ 12? ?? It was a small amount. Other menus can be ordered by paying the difference. Please note that coffee and drinks will be charged separately. There is really nothing in the area, so it is recommended that you buy and bring food at the airport or in San Francisco. If you drive Uber for about 5 minutes nearby, there are shopping facilities with multiple targets and restaurants, so please use it.\n",

In addition, it ended up being very expensive in restaurant prices as we could not use the room facilities balcony for dining as we had expected and hoped on but instead had to go out into the city and eat every meal It runs up in the New York Rooftop terrace restaurant as there was also advertising right with was also closed So all in all we did not think we got refunded the change had cost us However the refund was better than nothing The receptionist so nice to lend us his own umbrella it could have been fine the hotel had to lend Otherwise we thought the hotel was fine easy for activities Brooklyn Bridge Battery Park China Town Little Italy Soho Metro station etc. Renovation of the subway meant, however, that they did not always stop at our station in the evening\n",
